While working on this hackathon, I used embedding generation and vector search and felt that the results were noticeably better compared to my previous experience with these functions in my job. In the past, the top-3 similar results were sometimes not very accurate, but this time the performance seemed improved. Although I don’t have numerical metrics to compare, this is my overall observation.
